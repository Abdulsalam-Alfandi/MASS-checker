    Write the class `EvenTest` which tests the implementation of the class `Even` shown below. This class just contains one method `isTrue` which is supposed to return `true` if the passed integer value is an even number. 

    ```java
    class Even {
    	public boolean isTrue(int num) {
    		if (num % 2 == 0) {
    			return true;
    		} else {
    			return false;
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```
